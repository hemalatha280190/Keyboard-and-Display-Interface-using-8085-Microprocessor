# Keyboard and Display Interface using 8085 Microprocessor
## Aim:
To write assembly language program (ALP) for accepting input from keyboard and displaying it on seven segment display or LEDs.
## Apparatus Required:
1.	8085 Online Simulator	
2.	PC or Laptop with Internet	Any
3.	Hex Keypad and 7-segment/LED display interface	Virtual
## Theory:
1. The keyboard sends ASCII or Hex values to microprocessor via input port.
2. The display shows character or number via output port.
3. Typically IN instruction is used to read from port and OUT instruction to write to port.
4. A delay loop is used to stabilize display.
5. Ports (say, Port 01H for input, 02H for output) are configured through simulator settings or assumed for coding.
## Program:
## Output:
## Result:
The program to interface keyboard and display with 8085 was successfully simulated using the online platform. Input from keyboard was accepted and output was displayed correctly.
